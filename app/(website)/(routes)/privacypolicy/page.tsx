        <p className="mb-4">The right to privacy is a fundamental right and is necessary to protect personal data as an essential facet of informational privacy. The growth of the digital economy has meant the use of data as a critical means of communication between people.

Personal information can be anything that identifies an individual. Our Data Privacy Policy not only covers our customers but also covers our business partners, franchisee partners, and suppliers.</p>

We control the framework which is primarily based upon ISO 27001:2013 which states:</p>
